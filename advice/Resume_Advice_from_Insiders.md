General Tips (from a couple Slack Workspaces)
* No Resume Fraud -- don’t list projects you didn’t really work on. Be able to describe or discuss any skill or project listed
* Don’t send a word doc -- use a .pdf, website, or LinkedIn (.pdf for emailing, website or LinkedIn for online reference)


### KForce
* Don’t include a website if it doesn’t exist, doesn’t look nice, etc.
* Make sure skills tie in to projects
* Keep older projects to short bullets. Expand on the latest and greatest projects
* Grammar!
* Have a professional email!


### Short Resume Reviews:
* Reverse Chronological for education -- put that latest and greatest degree first
* For volunteering/interests, if it’s relevant, put it in there. If not, keep if off the resume
   * LinkedIn is good for this
* Snappy blurbs can be eye catching
* If you’re doing UI/UX or webdev, make sure you’ve got a nice looking online presence
* If you can incorporate what you did for the business into the resume, that’s great. 
* How important is location? Local vs. non-local?
* LinkedIn -- keep it up to date, engage with groups
* Relevant coursework is relevant. But don’t just give course numbers, give information
* Research the company you’re interested in


### Feedback


* More interactive -- interactive is good
* Topics are very good
* Hearing the feedback during the group helps understand the tools/things that we need to get into
* Liked seeing resumes
   * Especially since they’re totally different
* Nice having examples that worked
* Really helpful to have recruiters and advisors (Since it their job!)
* Workshop resumes -- bring in resumes, pair up -- “Speed Dating for Resumes”
* Find some more “Mentor” types to show up. 
   * For those of us already in it, find more folks. 
* Keep doing more about Networking
